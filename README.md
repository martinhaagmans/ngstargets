# Targets for NGS-pipeline
********************************

**These files exist for every capture:**

    - list with genes/targets on the capture
    - BED-file  with regions of interest (exonplus20)
    - BED-file  with annotated regions of interest
    - BED-file with transcription region for genes of interest
    - picard interval lists for target regions


**These files exist for every typeA-panel:**

    - list with genes/targets in the panel
    - BED-file with regions of interest extracted from the capture's annotated region of interest BED-file
